## About Me

Senior Platform & Database Engineer and Site Reliability Engineer with 10+ years of experience building, operating, and optimizing cloud-based data and application platforms.

I’m currently a Site Reliability Engineer at Appspace, where I design, maintain, and operate mission-critical infrastructure and application systems in modern cloud environments. I bring deep experience in platform and database engineering and architecture, with a focus on driving reliability, performance, and cost efficiency across the stack.

Throughout my career, I’ve led initiatives to migrate legacy systems to managed cloud services, improve platform and database performance, and strengthen observability and deployment processes. I have a strong understanding of how complex systems interact to drive reliability, scalability, and operational resilience.

My core focus is at the intersection of platform engineering, data systems, and site reliability. I specialize in building resilient cloud platforms, modernizing legacy systems, and enhancing the performance, reliability, and cost efficiency of data-intensive cloud systems.

## Background

I have over a decade of experience spanning backend software development, database engineering, and site reliability engineering, with the majority of my career focused on building and operating SaaS platforms at scale.

I began my career as a software developer, supporting production environments through on-call rotations and operational responsibilities. Over time, my work increasingly centered on data-intensive systems, performance troubleshooting, and reliability concerns, which led me to specialize in database engineering and platform-focused development.

For several years, I worked primarily as a database developer and architect, designing and optimizing large SQL Server environments, leading data migrations, improving query performance, and supporting global SaaS workloads. This deep data background strongly informs my work as a Site Reliability Engineer, particularly when diagnosing production issues, improving system performance, and balancing reliability with cost.

Today, my role blends platform engineering, data systems, and site reliability. I focus on designing and building migration tooling, operating resilient cloud platforms, improving observability and automation, modernizing and migrating legacy systems, and ensuring that critical infrastructure and data services remain reliable, scalable, and efficient.
